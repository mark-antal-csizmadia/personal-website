# My personal portfolio website

This README file aims to give a brief introduction and summary of my personal portfolio webiste. The repository contains all of the code used for the website that is deployed at http://www.markcsizmadia.com/. 

## Introdcution

Creating this website was the first time for me to come in contact with web development. As my universtiy studies concentrated on electronics and scientific programming, I did not have the chance to work on any similar project.

I learned a lot while learning about web development and had fun along the way. At first, the lot of new information was a bit daunting, but in the span of 2 weeks, I managed to gain a holistic understanding of developing and deploying a website.

## Aims and Objectives

The aim of the project was to gain a general understanding of we development and responsive web design. Nowadays, everything is written digitally online, and I felt that due to my electronic engineering background, I did not have enough experience in web development to stay relevant. Furthermore, repsonsive web design is also a prevailing technology today that enables website and web applciations to be viewed on different devices ranginf from wide-screens to mobile.

The objectives included building a responsive, one-page-long portfolio web site that includes the usual elements such as an About section, a Projects section, and a Contact section. Furthermore, I plan on sharing my personal and preofessional development in the future (e.g.: MSc Machine Learning degree programme at KTH Stockholm), so I decided to attach a Blog application as well.

## Technologies

As my bread and butter is Python, I selected Django, the popular Python web development framework as the backend. For the frontend, I used HTML5, CSS3 and Boostrap 4, a popular CSS framework developed and maintained by Twitter. Furthermore, I used jQuery and Javascript.
I used a great deal of online sources to better grasp the concepts that I came across, but I started out with this amazing series about web development in Django (URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmljXZIypDc&list=PL-osiE80TeTtoQCKZ03TU5fNfx2UY6U4p).

Furthermore, I learned how to deploy a website by storing media contents such as images in an AWS S3 Bucket, and deploying the filesystem of the project to Heroku. I also learned how to purchase a domain name and redirect traffic from the default Herokudomain to the custom http://www.markcsizmadia.com/.

## Conclusion

I can confidently say that I gained a general understanding of web development and repsonsive webdesign. I learned a new face of Python via Django, and learned new technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, Boostrap 4, and Javascript. The learning and creating process was fun, and I am certain that I will make use of these newfound skills in the future!

# Known Issues

There are currently no known issues. The website is fully functional, and every feature is working as expected. The website is deployed at http://www.markcsizmadia.com/.
