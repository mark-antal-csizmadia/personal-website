                                                Competition (OKTV). Consequently, I decided to pursue a science undergraduate

                                                These included the University of Manchester, the University of Southampton,

                                                read a lot about deep learning and the need for efficient artificial
                                                intelligence accelerators. Therefore, I decided to
                                                <span class="text-underline">specialize in electronic engineering</span>
                                                so that I could gain a thorough understanding of computer systems
                                                architecture and electronic chip design. The modules I took helped me build
                                                strong foundations for understanding the need for efficient hardware for
                                                real-time artificial intelligence applications.

                                                into the software, which would likely further improve the
                                                mathematical models. After the meeting, I spent days thinking about how to add
                                                deep learning to the software, but I realized that I did not have the
                                                necessary knowledge to do so. As I wanted to explore the viability of

                                                While working on my final year individual thesis project, I grew certain that
                                                I wanted to pursue a career in machine learning and deep learning. Therefore, I
                                                applied to graduate degree programs offered by the KTH Royal Institute of

                                                the University College London (London, United Kingdom).
